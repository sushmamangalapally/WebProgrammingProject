She also designed the interactive graph for the visualization page using SVG, and contributed to the styling and content for the home page. Sushma Mangalapally worked on the catalog layout and functionality using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. She also created the forum page and connected both the registration form and login option with a MySQL database to store user info, as well as designed the activity page. As extra we added the lightning bolt EdCamps logo, designed by Sushma.
